# Implementation-of-End-to-End-Learning-for-Self-Driving-Cars-
This repo has the implementation of Nvidia's End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars using Sully Chan Dataset collected by him  as collecting data from car's steering wheel isn't an ease so had no option other than using Sully Chan's dataset.

I have tried to be as close as possible,with some exceptions in data the model does fail to give accurate predictions for steering angle.

Special thanks to Sully Chan that he has provided his dataset one can dowload from his repo from here https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow
